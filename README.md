**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/develop/linux_sql)]: Optimizing the efficient operation of a Linux cluster composed of numerous nodes/servers running CentOS 7, the Linux cluster monitoring agent aims to collect comprehensive hardware characteristics for each node and deliver real-time resource monitoring, encompassing CPU and memory data. Employing a reliable Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), the agent stores the data, empowering the Linux cluster management team to generate analytical reports for informed resource allocation.

**Country Club Database Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/develop/sql)]: Executed a comprehensive exploration of SQL in the CD (Country Club) Database Project, demonstrating fluency in fundamental and advanced queries, including JOIN operations and aggregations with strings. These skills are applied to a dynamic dataset simulating a Country Club's membership system, facilities, and bookings. This project showcases a practical and nuanced understanding of SQL, underscoring its applicability in effective database management and analysis.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/develop/core_java)]:
      
  - Stock App: The Stock Quote App fetches real-time stock quotes from a REST API endpoint and updates the database housed within a Docker container with the retrieved data. Users can interact with the application to buy and sell stocks, view their portfolio, and fetch new stock quotes. The app leverages JDBC for database connectivity and incorporates Mockito for unit and integration testing.
  - Grep App: The Java Grep App is a command-line utility inspired by Linux grep, allowing users to search for and extract lines matching a specified pattern within files. Built in core Java, it supports both Docker and JAR execution for efficient pattern searching in diverse environments.

**PySpark Fundamentals** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SaghanaMaheshsarma/tree/develop/spark)]: Demonstrated proficiency in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations using PySpark through the creation and execution of a comprehensive project. It covers various topics such as data extraction from diverse sources, transformation using PySpark DataFrame operations, and loading into managed tables in Databricks. The exercises are designed to enhance understanding of PySpark and its applications in real-world data processing scenarios.


## Highlighted Projects
