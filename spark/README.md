**Introduction:**

This project is a collection of exercises and solutions designed to help users learn and practice Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations using PySpark. The exercises cover a range of topics, including reading data from various sources, transforming it using PySpark DataFrame operations, and loading it into managed tables in Databricks. These exercises are intended to familiarize users with the Databricks platform and notebook environment, as well as to help them write ETL jobs that utilize multiple data sources.

**Setup and Execution:**

- Clone the repository to your local machine or Databricks workspace.
- Open the notebooks in your preferred environment (Databricks notebook or Jupyter notebook).
- Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to execute the code and understand the results.
- Ensure to replace placeholder values such as API keys, database connection details, and file paths with actual credentials and paths.


**Implementation:**

The project is organized into different sections:

1. **ETL Jobs:** This section contains PySpark scripts for performing ETL operations on various data sources, including CSV files, HTTP requests, Parquet files, and RDBMS. Each script demonstrates how to extract data, transform it using DataFrame operations, and load it into managed tables.

2. **SQL Exercises:** Here, you'll find SQL queries written using PySpark DataFrame API. The queries cover a variety of SQL exercises such as filtering, aggregation, joining, and sorting data.

3. **DataFrames Using HTTP Requests:** Examples in this section illustrate how to retrieve data from external APIs using HTTP requests and process it using PySpark DataFrames.

4. **Parquet:** This section showcases working with Parquet files in PySpark, including reading, writing, and manipulating Parquet data.

5. **Partitions:** Learn how to use partitions in PySpark for optimizing data storage and retrieval. Examples include partitioning data by specific columns and saving it into managed tables partitioned by a specific column.

6. **RDBMS:** This section demonstrates extracting data from a relational database management system (RDBMS) using PySpark, performing transformations, and loading the data into managed tables.
